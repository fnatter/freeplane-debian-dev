 Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
 making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and
 conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole
 combination.
 .
 As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give
 you permission to link this library with independent modules to
 produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these
 independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
 executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet,
 for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the
 license of that module. An independent module is a module which is
 not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this
 library, you may extend this exception to your version of the
 library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to
 do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
