# Example watch control file for uscan
# Rename this file to "watch" and then you can run the "uscan" command
# to check for upstream updates and more.
# See uscan(1) for format
# Just check status: uscan --report-status

# the uversionmangle is needed because we have release numbers like 1.2.21_04!
# the dversionmangle is needed because we have added "+dfsg1" to the
# upstream version!

# Compulsory line, this is a version 3 file
version=3
