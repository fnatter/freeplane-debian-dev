freeplane for Debian
--------------------

Without installing the recommended xdg-utils, Freeplane won't be able to open
links as it's using xdg-open to do so, and it will fail SILENTLY!

Changes against 1.2.x upstream version:
- Update check disabled (in menu + on startup)
- Automatic bug reports disabled (but problems should be indicated in the
  bottom left corner of the window)
